- Write 2-3 sentences describing the relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input.

The relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input is using the failure-inducing input is to detect the symptom, which could potentionally prevent the bugs to happen. This can help test code and remove future bugs that could cause a program to fail, or not work as intended.
